# Analysis of Wildfire and Controlled Burn frequency, size and severity in the United States 

This project is focused on looking at how the size, frequency and severity of wildfires has changed over time both across the Unites States as a whole, as well as within specific states. This project also seeks to compare the change in frequency of wildifres over time to prescribed burns over time. 

This project uses data from The USGS Science Base catalog, in a study titled 'Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Burned Areas Boundaries' (version 11.0, January 2025). The data can be found here: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e7229b8e4b01d509268afba

This dataset includes wildfire and prescribed fire information from 1984 - 2024 across the continental United States. For supporting evidence and explanation, we also reference the paper by Eidenshink et al. (2007) titled 'A Project for Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity'. Available here: https://www.mtbs.gov/sites/mtbs/files/inline-files/Eidenshink-final.pdf. 

The Colab document contains detailed information on how we produced our analysis, as well as our outputs. The Presentations slides contain key takeaways and interpretation of results. 

Within this Repository, we have multiple files:

Final Consolidated Code: This Colab document contains our consolidated, detailed code for undertaking analysis.

cb_2018_us_state_500k.zip: State boundaries

mtbs_CA_xxxx.tif: These files contain DNBr values for each year for the state of California.
